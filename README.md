- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonathan-ok
- ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering. I also very much enjoy the process and design of work delivery flows - whether that be scrum, kanban, or anything else that makes sens for the team. Outside of tech I enjoy DIY, brewing beer and mead, waterfowl and upland game hunting, running, and soccer. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning and there is always something new - new ways to build infrastructure with Terraform, new AWS or Azure services to learn and try, a new hosting strategy, a new way to vizualize work, or some new way to monitor and collect metrics.
